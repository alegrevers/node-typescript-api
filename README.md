# Intro

The conecpt of this project is to use the best and solid patterns that we have today in software development. I used the best pratices with Typescript using composition over inheritance, TDD, JWT validation, and many others that I would like to invite you to check my code. The idea of this project is based on a free course on [Youtube by Waldemar Neto](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLz_YTBuxtxt6_Zf1h-qzNsvVt46H8ziKh). The function is very simple but the architecture is very strong. I also would notice you that I've made some changes compared to the original project on Waldemar's Git, and improve the GitHub Actions to work with different tech than what are used in course.
